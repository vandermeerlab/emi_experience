Overview
========

This control script is used for training rats to run on a maze.
The layout of the maze is a T-shape, with 3 segments for each arm.
Every trial is *forced*, with a transparent barrier blocking one arm, 
such that the rat returning from one feeder only has one option for the next trial.
Rats receive 2 pellets at the completion of every trial.
This is to ensure the rat:

1. Runs on a maze for reward
2. Is familiar with the feeders giving reward
3. Is familiar with the transparent barriers and experimenter nearby

Each session consists of the following:

- Pre-run [On pedestal; 10 minutes]
- Run [On maze; 20 of each 3 trial types]
- Post-run [On pedestal; 10 minutes]
