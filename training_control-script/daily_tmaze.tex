\section*{T-Maze daily running protocol in RR3}
\subsection*{Daily protocol overview}
Start Neuralynx and initialize MATLAB script, weigh rats, run session, feed rat, clean-up.

\subsection*{Set up}
\begin{todolist}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
\item Turn on computer (password: cheetah)
\item Turn on Neuralynx, wait for it to boot (stable green boot light)
\item Turn on the black interface box above the Neuralynx acquisition system
\item Turn on the white noise machine to the highest setting
\item Open MATLAB (use controlscript\_training.m)
\item Once Neuralynx has stabilized, run the Cheetah softward, hit \textsl{Select A Different Startup File}, open with tmaze\_behavior.cfg
\item Open and save a new YYYY$-$MM$-$DD\_notes.txt file in the daily folder
\item Turn on the wall lights and adjust the dimmer to the marked line
\item In Cheetah, press \textsl{ACQ} to start acquisition
\item In MATLAB, change phase.north\_first (alternates daily between 1 and 0 for North or South start). Note which start in notes.txt file
\item Initialize and maze by running all but the last cell blocks
\item Check the feeders (dispensed 2 pellets each) and photobeams (the red LED lights up when broken)
\item Go to the vivarium to weigh the rat and bring him to the running room
\end{todolist}

\subsection*{Run experimental session}
\begin{todolist}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
\item Put the rat on the pedestal in RR3
\item Hit ``Record'' in Cheetah for pre$-$maze pedestal phase (5~minutes to start)
\item Unclick ``Record'' wait about 1~minute
\item Hit ``Record'' in Cheetah for maze phase
\item Run the final block of code in MATLAB to start the task
\item Ensure barrier(s) are correct based on MATLAB display
\item Put rat on maze
\item Follow trial sequence from the MATLAB display
\item Put rat on pedestal when trials are completed OR max time has passed (45~minutes to start)
\item Unclick ``Record'' wait about 1~minute
\item Hit ``Record'' in Cheetah for post$-$maze pedestal phase (5~minutes to start)
\item Unclick ``Record''
\end{todolist}

\subsection*{Clean up}
\begin{todolist}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
\item In Cheetah, unclick ACQ to end the acquisition. Close Cheetah.
\item Close MATLAB.
\item Return the rat to its homecage and back to the vivarium. Feed the rat and note amount in the appropriate binder.
\item Move today's output from the Daily folder to the data folder generated by Neuralynx ($*$\_tmaze.png, $*$\_tmaze.txt, $*$\_notes.txt)
\item Rename Events.nev to YYYY$-$MM$-$DD\_Events.nev
\item Rename data folder to R\#\#\#\_YYYY$-$MM$-$DD\_behavior and move to the experience folder
\item Save the data folder to a USB
\item Clean the maze and barriers with Clidox
\item Turn off the white noise machine
\item Turn off the lights, black interface box, Neuralynx and computer
\item Put the data on the server 
\end{todolist}
